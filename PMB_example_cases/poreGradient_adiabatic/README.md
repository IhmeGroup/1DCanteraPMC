# Flame stabilized in pore-graded porous medium

Porous medium with porosity gradient. The flame stabilizes in the velocity field inside the porous medium.
This example shows the case where the flame is perfectly adiabatic, i.e. no heat losses through radiaion axially or laterally,
thus both the flame and the solid reach the adiabatic flame temperature at the end of the computational domain.
