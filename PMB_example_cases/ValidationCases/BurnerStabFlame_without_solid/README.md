# Burner-stabilized flame with deactivated solid

Burner-stabilized flame inside a porous medium with constant porosity. The solid material is deactivated (this corresponds to zero heat transfer coefficient).
Thus, the standard Burner-stabilized  flame solution from the unmodified Cantera code is recovered.
