# Freely propagating flame with deactivated solid

Freely propagating flame inside a porous medium with constant porosity. The solid material is deactivated (this corresponds to zero heat transfer coefficient).
Thus, the standard freely propagating flame solution from the unmodified Cantera code is recovered.
