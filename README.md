# PMCToolbox

PMCToolbox is an extension of Cantera (https://github.com/Cantera/cantera) for
reactive flows in porous media.

For install instructions, see

``install_instructions_Mac.txt``

``install_instructions_Ubuntu.txt``

For Windows, install Ubuntu in WSL and follow the install instructions for Ubuntu.

Example cases for combustion in porous media as well as validation cases are located in

``PMB_example_cases/``

Details of the implemented numerical methods and models can be found in the section below.

Equations, model description, and numerics can be found in the Github wiki (work in progress -- see Combustion and Flame paper for now).
